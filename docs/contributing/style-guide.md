# Style guide (documentation)
A style guide helps ensure that the documentation is consistent and thus easier to read.
### Spelling
1. Please use British English spellings throughout the project.
```
centre, not center
colour, not color
``` 
2. Words with an 'ize/ise' suffix should be spelt using the 'ise' suffix.
```
normalise, not normalize
pluralise, not pluralize
```
### Vocabulary
The choice of vocabulary should make the documentation accessible to the greatest number of people possible. Simpler wording and phrasing is to be preferred to more complicated wording and phrasing.
