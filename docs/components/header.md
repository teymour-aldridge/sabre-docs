# Headers
### Basic usage
A header is created using the `.header` class. 
```html
<header class="header">
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h3>A not-so catchy tagline.</h3>
</header>
```
### Variables
The variable `$side-padding` controls the amount of left-right padding. This variable also affects the padding of other 
layout components, such as `container`. This is to ensure that all elements are in line on the page.
